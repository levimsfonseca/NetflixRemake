# NetflixRemake
This application was a simplified version of the initial dashboard of the famous application for streaming movies and series: Netflix. It was developed from scratch with the help of a simple database just to exemplify the titles and descriptions of some films to check a preview of how the final result would look. My instructor ans specialist Tiago Aguiar also help me to complete this achievement.
